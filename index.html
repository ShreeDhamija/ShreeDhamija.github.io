<p> Most people hire visual artists through Instagram. And it's a pain in the ass. You can't filter by <em>style, price or availability</em>. Some people have the audacity to <em>demand free work</em> from you. Not anymore. <em>Curio</em> is a marketplace tailored to visual artists.<em>Illustrators, Animators, 3D Modellers</em> all of them. Visual Artists deserve better than Fiverr, Upwork and Instagram DMs as their source of work and we're here for it.</p>
